Cute color and nice feel. I haven't used it while out and about, but from using it at home it seems like it might be a little loud for use at a restaurant or something like that. It would be good for a club or somewhere with more noise. The controller works, I wish it were a little smaller, but it does what it's supposed to.

Pretty quiet, but if you were in absolute silence, anyone standing five feet from you would be able to hear something, but perfect if you’re in a very public and loud place. Remote control worked great. It came in an Amazon box, so it didn’t say what it was on the box (discreet packaging) so it’s perfect if you live with others and don’t want them knowing what kind of fun you’ll be up to.

,published,5,"Great way to enhance a date",DB,masterdeonblack@gmail.com,,"So this product met my expectations completely.
It is light weight and the material it is made from is smooth and non irritating. The remote design is a little awkward (large) but functional.  I tested the remote from one foot away from device up to about  6 feet away - while in panties and it works well. Remote works from further away if not covered.
The device lights up when on so you know it is working. Must be turned on manually and not with the remote. It kind of sounds like a phone ringing while vibrating but when out and about the sound isn't really noticeable at all. Doesn't take long to charge with the USB provided.

Definitely a fun toy to take out to enhance a date.",,"02/07/22, 05:00:00",

Until this one!! It’s so cute, it’s the perfect size for me, it’s got a ton of different settings, which normally I never use (on and harder are the only two settings anyone really needs right?lol), but I actually prefer some of the creative vibration setting more than the basic ones! It’s also not loud, and it’s easy to control.

The remote is a weird shape and size, but keeping it in the box makes everything really east to store when putting away. Honestly, I’m considering buying another so me and my gf can both have one!

  &nbsp;When reviewing wireless toys like these I personally like to rate them on how hard it can vibrate while making the least amount of noise. That being said, for it’s price it’s a really comfortable and lightweight product. When testing it out I noticed how it can be heard lightly when just played with without any clothing. Thought when kept under panties it is almost impossible to hear this product making it a handing thing to use when roommates are asleep. Overall this is a really good product to get your significant other when you just need something new to spice up your sex life. As for the remote control. It’s not extremely far range, maybe a little less range than a remote control car key, but it’s as simple as two buttons. One to change the mode and one to pause the vibration easily when you need a break. Both are easy to charge as you don’t need to plug it into anything. This definitely helps in any scenarios where water is a factor. (Swimming, showers, etc)",,"01/06/22, 18:00:00",

And it's very quiet so that if you decide to be naughty in public no one will be the wiser. The only negative is that it's hard for the person using the remote to know which setting it's on, or to even know it has started unless there is a reaction from the wearer, which to be fair there usually is especially if they are not expecting it.

It has a great shape, neither too thick nor too thin, which results in a really nice filling sensation when it's inside. The material is nice and soft. The vibrations are nice, not the strongest at the tip but still good, and I especially like the inclusion of multiple patterns of vibration to give some variance to using the toy.

One area where this toy shines unexpectedly is in its remote. Usually, sex toy remotes are cheap and don't work that well, but that isn't the case here. The remote is rechargeable (with the same cable as the toy) rather than using a battery, and I've never had any problems with connecting the remote or having it respond. One of the few toys I actually like using the included remote on.

The included magnetic charging solution works pretty well and probably helps with the toy staying waterproof. Cleaning is just as easy as you'd expect for a full silicone toy like this one.",,"01/08/22, 08:00:00",

I did have to charge the remote when I first received it. However I was able to use the vibrator by itself without the remote. It didn’t take long for the remote to charge. It does have a big “head” so to speak, so make sure you are ready before inserting. Once it’s in it feels great. The way it’s shaped it doesn’t fall out if you’re standing up. The part that sticks out lays against the backside of scrotum. So you get stimulated on the outside too. The toy is pretty flexible. Especially the outside part. Both the toy and remote have a place to charge on the backside. The red button on toy and remote turns on/adjusts the vibrating settings. The packaging is nice. There’s a 1-year warranty and a thank you surprise in the card. Overall very happy with the vibrator. Will be using again this weekend. Make sure to use water based lube.

On another note, the variety of settings is awesome.  3 intensities, followed by the different vibe patterns. It is very quiet, and damn strong lol.  I'm single, but the remote works just fine and will be great for changing intensity while also not having to press the button on the vibe itself, which can be awkward and uncomfortable considering where these lovelies spend their time ☺️",,"01/01/22, 04:00:00",

PRO#2 the packaging was NOT ONLY discreet, cheap/affordable but ALSO looked pretty professional the way the product was insulated and packaged(was honestly shocked on the quality for the price) now my PRO#3 really shocked me with the fact that the product was ready to use fresh out the box but ALSO as a thorough bonus, inside under the cushion of the box,included a. Small double sidded piece of paper with the simplest quick start guide of use I've seen in some time(which shocked me because every once in a blue moon id be lucky to get a manual let alone a SIMPLIFIED one that i can understand) my ONLY CON about this product is the remote feels a bit cheaply built compared to the vibrator(but it came with a 1 yr.

Use some cation with the charging cable if left plugged into the power. We have had this for over a year and this was the first time it happened. The end of the charging cable has a magnet, which holds it against the toy to charge. As you can see from the picture, it attached itself to my Apple Watch’s metal band.  It heated the band to a temperature that allowed the plastic to fuse to the watch band (white spot). When I went to pick up the watch, I must have touched the very edge of the band because it also burned a blister about a 3/4” long and the width of the band edge. As you can also see from the picture, it deformed the connection point, which is no longer useable. Just make sure you unplug it after charging.

Pros: lots of different settings and the remote made it easy to change them, the vibration is strong, medium-low sound level, we both finished at the same time

There are only 2 cons but they weren't too much of a problem, I'm just picky.
1. The distance/shape of the larger end didn't line up exactly for me. I think that more surface area on the larger end would be better to account for differences in anatomy
2. The charging port on the back kind of dug into my partner's skin. It didn't hurt, it was just obvious it was there and may chafe over a long session.

Overall, I definitely recommend!",,"01/07/22, 23:00:00",
,published,4,"Amazing overall!","Anna B",masterdeonblack@gmail.com,,"This product is awesome. Bought it to spice things up with my boyfriend and it has definitely done that! The only real complaint he has is that he can feel the power button when the large side is inserted along with him. if we turn it around and use the smaller side, I still feel it and it's more comfortable for him.

When I use it alone, it's just as epic. I usually have to get it JUST right with any other vibrator but with this one, I put it in, turned it on, read a good story (if you know what I mean) and that's all it took. The battery life is awesome as well which is great. I've never had it die on a session, especially if it's been charged recently.

The remote control is super cool. It's the feature my boyfriend really enjoys haha. The button isn't very quiet, however. The remote is necessary even if you're alone because it's hard to reach the button on the device while it's inserted.

Overall, I'm happy with this device. It's a lot smaller than I expected but I think that's. a good thing. I think I was expecting it to be bigger because of what my other toys are like. But if it was bigger, it wouldn't work how it's advertised.",,"01/07/22, 22:00:00",

I have tried a couple vibrators this past year, and so far this one seems to be of the same quality from what I have come to expect. Everything is better in multiplayer.

It has a magnetic charging port as to keep its water resistance. So far, the cable seems to hold on nicely for both the vibrator and the controller while charging and has easily readable LED indicators to know when they are plugged in. (Keep in mind that it only comes with 1 charging cable, but both devices need to be charged before use)

The controller itself is pretty lightweight and easy enough to use. Simple 2 button setup. On / Off and a selection button that cycles between the available modes.

The noise level seems to be consistent with my experience with vibrators thus far, and I would say the actual strength of the vibration seems to be more than acceptable.

Overall, I'd say that it is exactly what I was expecting and have no complaints.",,"02/06/22, 05:00:00",

First off let's look into the comparison of sizes for the toys. The Fleshlight Masturbator is noticeably wider and longer allowing for larger package gentlemen to also get in on the fun. On the other side, the Zemalia masturbator looks thinner, shorter and smaller in general, for men with smaller members it's a good fit, for average members it's still all right but it's cutting it close, but for large membered folks, it won't be a good choice to buy.",,"01/08/22, 08:00:00",

I was originally put off from the realistic-looking mouth section, however, after using the toy for a while you get used to it. The toy was supposed to be a gag item that my girlfriend chose for me to use in my free time, but I honestly have been enjoying my time with this toy.

The mouth opening includes a tongue and teeth. Personally, I don't really use the mouth section of the toy, but the extra stimulation from the teeth can spice it up if you are feeling tired of using the pussy and the ass. The pussy opening has more texture and feels much better the deeper you go due to the added cock rings. The ass, on the other hand, is much tighter and feels just as good. For me, my go-to hole would be the ass. The best perk about this toy is how easy the cleaning is. You can easily stretch out the mouth or pussy, and have water flow through.

This toy is definitely worth buying, due to the three provided holes that each provide their own type of stimulation and how easy it is to clean the toy.",,"24/05/21, 00:00:00",

They call this piece by the name of Doreen, it's cute. It does take a lot of lube and a lot of time after use for cleaning. It can become tacky but nothing a little cornstarch won't fix. My husband is a average to above average size anywhere between 8 to 9 inches and when inserted it goes all the way through to the other end. I got to say that the design on this is super cute. Although it's just the body parts the face is my favorite well I should say the nose lips and teeth. The nose is cute the lips are luscious and the teeth give a nice visual. According to hubby not much for stimulation but super cute nonetheless. Maybe used it a few times and it has done the job, or Doreen has done her job,;). Great starter toy for any couple or any guy looking for something different than the palm. Personally I enjoy watching my hubby during masturbation and this was definitely a turn-on for me. Him on the other end, he likes it when I perform better of course, but hopefully when I'm away from home he can gain some pleasurable moments. I wish it lit his fire as much as it lights mine but nonetheless he uses it and she does her job. It does have two other openings of course the anal opening is the tightest however not the most pleasurable for my hubby. Like I said a good starter toy or for any man looking for something a little different. Just remember, use lubrication and grip it tight and it will definitely serve you well.",,"01/05/22, 04:00:00",

The product has an amusing look to it, it has little stubby arms on its sides, and paired with the mouth it looks like a little slug woman.
The product has a very soft gooey dough texture, which feels nice to hold in your hands, however, I found it difficult to use this product due to its looseness. When the product first arrived it was covered in a fine dusting which I had assumed was to protect it during storage and shipping. I highly recommend you clean the product before and after every time you use it. Cleaning the product will reveal that the ""lower cavity"" will hold dampness, I would dry it with a towel or cotton ball, but aft washing the initial dust off the product becomes very sticky. If you own a pet I would be careful because it is difficult to remove any hair that gets stuck.
I found that what works great is to insert my vibrator into the ""lower cavity"" which tightens up the rest of the product and provides a bonus vibration.",,"01/03/22, 23:00:00",
